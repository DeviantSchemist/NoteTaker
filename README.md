  ## Description
  An application that lets you take notes on whatever you like and save them for reference. Free of bloatware and ads that run rampant on many other applications, straightforward and succinct. Open it up whenever you need to refer back to something either for school, work, or just having a general to do list for the day.

  ## Installation
  Have node.js installed on your IDE/Text Editor of your choice (in my case it is VS Code).

  ## Usage
  Run this command: node index.js and follow the prompts in your terminal to answer the questions. Afterwards, a README.md file will be created in your project's root directory.

  ## Contribution
  Clone this repository, and make branches based on whatever feature you are working on. Send pull requests for completed features.

  ## Tests
  Same as usage information. Except, feel free to enter in unexpected inputs and see what the application will do.
